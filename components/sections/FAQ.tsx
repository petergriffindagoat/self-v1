    q: "Do you work exclusively with self-storage operators?",
    a: "Yes. Self-storage is our only vertical. Every strategy, template, and benchmark we use comes from patterns we see across our client portfolio in this one industry.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if my website was built on a platform like WordPress or a custom CMS?",
    a: "We work across WordPress, Webflow, Squarespace, Shopify, and most custom CMSes. In the audit phase we assess whether your current platform can support the changes we recommend. If a rebuild is the better long-term answer, we tell you honestly.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to stop running Google Ads?",
    a: "No. Many clients keep paid search running during the first few months while organic gains materialize. Once organic volume is steady, most clients reduce or eliminate ad spend on their own. We also advise on Ads if helpful.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is included in the free audit?",
    a: "A detailed report on your current organic visibility, Google Business Profile health, technical site issues, top three local competitors, and a prioritized list of the quickest wins available to you. You can act on the audit whether you work with us or not.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this a long-term contract?",
    a: "The initial engagement is ninety days because meaningful SEO results need that window to materialize. After that, everything is month-to-month with thirty days notice.",
